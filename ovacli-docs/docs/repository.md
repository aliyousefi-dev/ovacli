## How it Find and Index Videos

when initilize a repository it make this tree steps on that folder.

### Disk Scaning

the default database for that is a simple json file but in production you can switch to the boltdb for better performance and reliability.

### Indexing algorithm

it use the Bucket Indexing algorithm. in this algorithm it bucket each video that are in same folder and bundle them and send them for indexing.

also when indexing it make a checksum from each video file and use that as id. here is more detail [Checksume algorithm](/docs/checksum)

### Cooking algorithm

cooking is after indexing . and it rely on the indexing. it check for indexed videos and then check is that cooked or not. if not cooked it try to cook that.

## Url Anatomy

the default database for that is a simple json file but in production you can switch to the boltdb for better performance and reliability.

```
http://localhost:4200/watch/:video-id
```
