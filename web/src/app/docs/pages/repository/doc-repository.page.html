    <p>when initilize a repository it make this tree steps on that folder.</p>

    <h3>Disk Scaning</h3>
    <p>the default database for that is a simple json file but in production you can switch to the boltdb for better
        performance and reliability.</p>

    <h3>Indexing algorithm</h3>
    <p>it use the Bucket Indexing algorithm. in this algorithm it bucket each video that are in same folder and bundle
        them and send them for indexing.</p>

    <p>also when indexing it make a checksum from each video file and use that as id. here is more detail <a

    <h3>Cooking algorithm</h3>
    <p>cooking is after indexing . and it rely on the indexing. it check for indexed videos and then check is that
