    <h1>Datasets</h1>
    <p>
        In ova, a dataset is a structured set of data, similar to a table in a database or a spreadsheet. Each dataset
        consists of multiple records (rows), where each record represents an individual entity (such as a user, session,
        or item), and each field (column) describes a specific attribute of that entity (for example: name, age, email).

    <p>
        The following tables store collections of records, where each record is an instance of a specific data structure
        defined elsewhere in the documentation. These tables are essential for organizing and managing the application's
        data.
